		<h1>About Blackboard Nepal</h1>
		<p>Blackboard Nepal is a concept of an online community platform. The idea originated from the need of an online platform for our community to come closer. Lots of Nepalese youth travel to other countries for their career or to earn money and improve the life quality of their family. We have to accept the fact that not all of them are good in communication, networking or language of the place they are living on. This pushes them behind. Many of such youths are in need of a platform to get connected to another person of community. Many do well adjusting to the new society but the transition is difficult. Exposure to the community from own national helps a lot to prevent such culture shock. Blackboard Nepal have made an effort to establish such a platform where Nepalese could come closer and help each other in the community. Blackboard Nepal aims to provide services to all the Nepalese people living anywhere in the world.  Starting with resources for Naati CCL test - Nepali, we have plans to bring more services to the community.</p>
