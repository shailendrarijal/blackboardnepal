			<h1>NAATI CCL Test Format</h1> <p>It is important to understand the test format before you begin your preparation. The Naati CCL test is a 20 minute test. The invigilator will announce the 20 minute time frame reached once you have commenced your test. You, as an interpreter need to interpret the conversation from English to LOTE and LOTE to English. There are two dialogues in your test and each dialogue is broken down into about 10 segments. Each segment is in either English or in LOTE. Your aim is to interpret from one language to another as efficiently as you can so that in a real scenario, you would be able to help two people from different ethnic background understand each other perfectly.</p>

		<div class="section_naaticclnepali">
			<h1> What happens after you enter the test center? </h1> <p> After you reach the test center, you will be required to sit in a room with other test takers and submit your passport or the document that you used to register for the test. Remember to take your document with you. They will then arrange your documents according to their list. Once your name is called, you will be taken by an invigilator to the test room. They will play the dialogues to you with each segment at a time. After the end of each segment, you will hear a chime which is an indication for you to start interpreting. You must not delay the initiation of your interpretation more than 5s after the chime. The segments will be alternating between English and LOTE.Remember to interpret in the correct language. </p>

			<h1> What is the format of the test? </h1><p> The test is of 90 marks; 45 marks for each dialogue. To pass the test, you have to get 29 marks out of 45 for each dialogues and in total, you have to get 63 out of 90. The marking is based on oral fluency and your ability to efficiently communicate. You can ask for 1 repitition per dialogue penalty-free. From second repition in a dialogue, you will be penalised. Similarly, you can ask for corrections if you think you have made a mistake. You must pronunce the word "correction" clearly so that the invigilator would hear you. Remember, this is an entirely audio-based test. It is always best to ask for an extra repitition or correction rather than to make mistakes when you know you made a mistake. Keep in mind that repitition means playing the audio again and correction means correcting the words or sentences that you said. The penalty for correction is entirely under the discretion of your examiner.</p>

		<h1> Learn the Vocabulary </h1><p> To be able to interpret fluently, you will need to increase your vocabulary of LOTE as well as English language. This will enable you to understand various aspects of Australian Society. When you have a good idea of terms like Centrelink, Home Loan, Federal and State police, Australian laws and regulations, you will have better understanding of the community where you want to spend your rest of the life. Here are the links to different sections for vocabulary.</p><hr>
